OpenSeated is an online restaurant reservation platform clone of OpenTable. The platform was developed using Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, React.js, and Redux. This project was designed and built in a ten day time period.


## Features

  * Users can view restaurant details including average overall ratings, food ratings, service ratings, value ratings, and ambience ratings.
